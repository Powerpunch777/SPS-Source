## Evidence Boundary

This document identifies the supported Desktop, Core, SDK, and extension tuple. The final SPS Source revision is fixed only by the immutable release tag and its generated `sps-release-manifest.json`. Physical multi-computer evidence must name that same Source revision and tuple; evidence from an older candidate cannot be reused.
